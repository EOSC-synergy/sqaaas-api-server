The SQAaaS API has a microservice design where a series of components, tools and services 
are used during its operation. Thus, by means of a container orchestration system, the 
deployment of a ready-to-use API endpoint can be streamlined. In this section we will use
the `docker-compose recipe <>` included in the repository to illustrate the deployment of
the SQAaaS API.
